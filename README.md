## Banking-Analytics-2020---Deep-Learning

In this coursework we will continue our study of mortgages in the US, but now we will analyze results
at a zipcode level. The question that we want to answer is “can satellite images help our modelling
process?”.

In this coursework, we will develop a multimodal deep learning model for this problem, and
compare it against other alternative models, using what you have learned in the lectures.

The following coding:
1. Create a logistic regression model that, using only the structured data, can predict whether an area is high risk or low risk;
2. Choose from Tensorflow Hub a model that’s adequate for the problem;
3.Combine the structured input of and the images, plus the pretrained model, to create a multimodal deep learning model that takes into account both inputs into a single neural network. Use the Keras Model API to create this model.
